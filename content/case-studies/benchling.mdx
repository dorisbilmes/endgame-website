Benchling, the R&D cloud for life sciences, evaluated multiple AI vendors before finding Endgame. What set Endgame apart was the depth of integration and data quality that their teams could actually rely on.

## The Challenge

Benchling's RevOps team had evaluated many AI vendors, but consistently found them lacking in one critical area: data quality. Most solutions were:

- Shallow on the data side
- Unable to integrate deeply with existing systems
- Producing outputs that teams couldn't trust

## The Endgame Approach

Endgame differentiated itself through:

1. **Deep Salesforce integration** that goes beyond surface-level data
2. **Gong integration** for complete conversation context
3. **Enablement content integration** so AI responses reflect company knowledge

## The Results

With Endgame, Benchling finally found an AI solution their teams trust:

- Unified data from Salesforce, Gong, and enablement content
- Outputs that reflect accurate, up-to-date information
- Team adoption driven by trust in data quality

> "Most AI vendors we evaluated were shallow on the data side. Endgame integrates deeply with Salesforce, Gong, and our enablement content, which gives us data quality our teams actually trust."
