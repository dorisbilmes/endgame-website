## All the right tools, none of the context

Hex had built a modern sales stack. Salesforce for pipeline management. Gong for conversation intelligence. Slack for team coordination. Each tool was working as intended.

The problem wasn't the tools—it was what happened between them. Reps were spending 30-60 minutes per account jumping between Salesforce, Gong, emails, and Google searches to piece together context before meetings or outreach. The information existed. Finding it, synthesizing it, and turning it into action was eating up time that should have been spent on deal strategy.

Hex didn't need more information. They needed the context from their existing systems connected and actionable when it mattered most. "We selected Endgame because it's purpose-built to drive GTM efficiency and boost seller productivity," says Vicky Chi, Head of Revenue Operations at Hex. "Its ability to turn our own data and customer interactions into actionable insights, rather than relying solely on static or third-party information, set it apart from other sales intelligence tools."

Most sales intelligence tools provide external intelligence. Endgame connects the context Hex already has across their conversations, CRM, and internal documentation. John Messina, VP of Revenue at Hex, points to connected context as the key differentiator. By synthesizing insights from Gong, Slack, and Salesforce, the team can act strategically at the account level with contextualized coaching and guidance. Chi describes the result as giving each seller "a personal strategic advisor that helps them prioritize and plan their day while keeping them firmly in control of the most strategic aspects of their work."

## Turning research into execution

Research that took 30-60 minutes now takes approximately 5 minutes. Meg O'Leary, Head of Revenue Enablement, explains that the platform helps pinpoint key contacts and generates compelling outreach rationales by analyzing account activities, recent news, and ideal roles to target. The multi-account view helps SDRs and AEs coordinate their prospecting efforts, eliminating duplication and ensuring comprehensive coverage.

For AEs managing multiple deals simultaneously, Endgame streamlines workflows that used to require bouncing between systems: gap analysis across opportunities, meeting preparation, and competitive positioning based on specific use cases.

Beyond efficiency, Endgame helps institutionalize Hex's sales approach. The platform reinforces their positioning, sales frameworks, and playbooks through the Knowledge hub, ensuring internal documentation actually influences execution rather than sitting unused. Hex also plans to use Endgame as a strategic coaching tool to identify knowledge gaps, ensure consistent application of sales frameworks, and provide targeted feedback based on conversation data. Messina sees this as a force multiplier, noting it will "give our enablement team significant leverage to scale coaching across the organization."

## Building the intelligence foundation

> "We evaluated over a dozen AI tools. Almost all of them focused on low-level tasks and email automation, but Endgame was different. Their entire approach is about getting the knowledge layer right, which gives us a level of accuracy we couldn't find anywhere else."

Hex sees Endgame evolving beyond a sales productivity tool into the intelligence foundation for their entire revenue organization. Chi explains they're excited to explore even deeper integrations with their Knowledge Hub and CRM, as well as use Endgame insights to inform enablement, product marketing, and territory planning. The long-term vision extends to the full customer lifecycle, with plans to leverage Endgame's capabilities to guide not just outreach, but also retention, expansion, and customer success strategies.

For a company built on making data collaboration easier, the parallel is clear: just as Hex helps their customers turn scattered data into collaborative decisions, Endgame connects context across their revenue systems so the team can act strategically with complete insight. "Since adopting Endgame, we've minimized the need to juggle between multiple tools," Chi says. This wasn't about replacing existing tools—it was about connecting them into a unified view where reps can quickly understand the full picture and determine next steps with confidence.
