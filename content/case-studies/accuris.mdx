Accuris, a leading provider of engineering and technical content, was looking for a way to scale their account planning process without adding headcount. What they found with Endgame exceeded all expectations.

## The Challenge

Accuris faced a common enterprise challenge: their account planning process was manual, time-consuming, and inconsistent across the team. Each account plan took significant effort, limiting how many accounts could receive strategic attention.

## The Endgame Approach

In their first 90 days with Endgame, Accuris:

1. **Automated account planning** at scale, generating comprehensive plans for every strategic account
2. **Standardized their methodology** by encoding best practices into Endgame templates
3. **Unified their data sources** to give reps complete account context

## The Results

The impact was immediate and substantial:

- Over 400 account plans automated in the first quarter
- 2.5x increase in pipeline generation versus the prior year
- Dramatic reduction in time spent on manual research

> "Endgame is the biggest shift in sales tech we've seen in the last decade, at least since CRM. In our first 90 days, we automated over 400 account plans, leading to a 2.5x increase in pipeline generation versus the prior year."
