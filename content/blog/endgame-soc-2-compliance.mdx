When we set out to transform how modern software companies go to market, we knew that our customer relationships would be built on trust. For PLG companies, product data is their most valuable asset, and they are partnering with us to turn that data into meaningful growth for their business. That's why we've built Endgame from the ground up with a security and privacy by design methodology.

As part of those efforts, we're excited to announce that we've obtained a clean SOC 2 Type I report, another important step towards being the #1 partner for fast-growing PLG companies and the leader in product-led sales.

## Our approach to SOC2

SOC2 provides the framework and rigor for us to scale as a remote-first business with security at the center of what we do everyday. Additionally, SOC2 is about transparency and making it easier for our champions to understand and communicate our approach to security with the rest of their organization.

We wanted to simplify that process and our SOC2 report does exactly that.

Now, we're leveraging automated monitoring and compliance from Drata to meet SOC2 requirements while providing us with the systems to scale up for the next phase of security standards and customer needs.

For customers that would like to receive a copy of the report, please email support@endgame.io.
