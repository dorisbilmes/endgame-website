CROs have spent the last two years trying to make their teams AI-native. Most have failed to see any real adoption or impact.

Until now.

Monte Carlo just achieved 80% AI adoption across their entire GTM team. Accuris automated over 400 account plans this quarter and increased pipeline generation by 2.5x. Scale, despite having world-class AI capabilities in-house, bought a platform that now preps their team for every high-stakes meeting.

These aren't outliers. They're the vanguard of what's inevitable.

The pattern until now was the same everywhere: power users built impressive prototypes for meeting prep, win/loss analysis, and rep coaching that worked in demos but collapsed at scale. Why? Because AI models are trained on public data. Not your deals, your calls, or your playbooks. They didn't know how you actually operate.

We solved this by rebuilding the entire context layer from the ground up and tailoring it to how you sell. Your CRM data, calls, emails, and Slack conversations, plus the public web, along with your training, enablement, and sales methodologies. All integrated and accessible to your entire team.

The result is collective awareness across your organization. Every person can see what's happening in any account, the full context of every interaction, and the accumulated knowledge of your best practices and performers. This changes how teams work: "I can pull up strategic insights across all our wins in seconds—the top 20 initiatives we're tied to, the best use cases for a specific industry. That quick identification helps us make deals move faster and larger," says Tim Miller, CRO at Monte Carlo.

We call this revenue superintelligence.

And it looks like this:

## Why the breakthrough is happening now

This required three pieces to come together simultaneously.

First, we built custom architecture from the ground up. Most AI products focus on the model layer. But superintelligence also requires context on all your internal and external information. You can't achieve that by dumping a hundred calls into an LLM, the context window explodes.

We made a different choice: heavy investment in data and context engineering. We restructure and clean all data upfront, dedupe Salesforce contacts, and enrich with external sources like LinkedIn. We extract and index facts from every account, interaction, email, call transcript, and news source—then surface only the relevant ones for each question with citations to show our work. On top of this, we built a superagent with a catalog of specialized skills—skills that embed your positioning frameworks, build account plans, and analyze deal inspections against your methodology. This enables consistent, accurate answers across the thousand types of questions sales teams actually ask.

Second, we figured out the workflow. Chat is one of the few interfaces that can handle millions of interconnected data points and that sales teams will actually use. With AI adoption in sales hitting 94% through GPT, teams already know how to interact this way. Combining this form factor with sales-native frameworks and outputs created a magical UX.

Third, the models finally got there. GPT-5 and Claude Opus 4.1 enabled truly general intelligence across accounts, not just single-account answers. Just in the last month, we've been able to increase speed in book-level questions by 10x for our faster "search" mode, and increase depth accuracy by close to 5x in our new "research" mode for more analytical prompts.

## What this looks like in practice

Over the past few months, we've watched a consistent pattern play out across our customer base. Companies like [Monte Carlo](/case-studies/monte-carlo), Scale, [BetterUp](/case-studies/betterup), [Hex](/case-studies/hex), Benchling, Mux, StackHawk, and Accuris are transforming how they go-to-market with Endgame at the core.

The change starts with individuals. Cassie Wages, a Strategic AE at Accuris, put it simply: "After trying many AI sales tools that never quite lived up to their hype, Endgame really stands out… my account planning became nearly effortless: what used to take weeks is now done in minutes, from mapping strategy and key contacts to uncovering new opportunities."

When users discover powerful prompts they can share them with everyone on the team. This accelerates adoption across roles and departments. Reps use Endgame daily for call prep and deal analysis. Sales leaders get real-time pipeline health without waiting for meetings. RevOps and Enablement apply process improvements and new trainings directly to workflow.

Jordan Van Horn, COO at Monte Carlo, sees the organizational impact: "Endgame has become the OS for our revenue team, with over 80% adoption. We've replaced consumer AI tools for everything from meeting prep to customer presentations to business analysis."

**To see what this looks like in practice, we pulled data from our top customers in the last 90 days. Here's what users are doing in Endgame:**

That's the shift happening across teams, not because AI was mandated but because it genuinely works. Methodology adherence is going up because it's in the natural flow of work. Productivity gains in workflows, such as customer deck creation and executive briefings, are massive. "What used to take an entire account team hours, Endgame does in minutes," says Austin Johnsey, Principal GTM Systems Architect at BetterUp.

## Your superintelligence, not ours

Every revenue organization is unique: different methodologies, sales motions, competitive landscapes. Endgame adapts to become your superintelligence.

Your data from every source (CRM, Gong, Slack, email, Google Drive), unified and mapped to reveal all customer relationships and interaction history. Your sales methodology and frameworks, encoded so the best practices you've developed over years live in every rep's workflow. Your team doesn't have to memorize your flavor of MEDDPICC, it becomes how deal inspections happen automatically. 

Endgame "accelerates daily activities with high degree of accuracy by reinforcing our positioning, sales frameworks, and playbooks" observes Meg O'Leary, Head of Sales Enablement at Hex.

For true impact, intelligence can't live in just one tab. You'll find Endgame wherever sales happens: in your browser, in Slack, through MCP integrations with Claude and other AI tools, and via workflow automation through Zapier and n8n.

## The business impact

Matt Baker, VP of GTM Strategy at Accuris, captures it best: "Endgame is the biggest shift in sales tech we've seen in the last decade, at least since CRM. In our first 90 days, we automated over 400 account plans, leading to a 2.5x increase in pipeline generation versus the prior year."

Scale chose to buy rather than build, despite having world-class AI capabilities in-house. "Every meeting at Scale is extremely high stakes—each could be worth tens of millions. Synthesizing all our account context and validating our strategy through Endgame before walking in is critical," notes Julio Bermudez, Global VP of GTM, Enterprise.

80% AI adoption without mandates. Pipeline generation up 2.5x. Hours of work compressed into minutes. This isn't incremental efficiency, it's a rewiring of how revenue teams operate.

## Your move

The gap is widening. Fast.

Superintelligent teams are outpacing everyone else with better prep, faster deals, and smarter decisions at every level. The companies that figure this out in the next 12 months will build a lead their competitors can't close.

We work with revenue leaders who see this moment and want to move now. Not to pilot another tool, but to partner with us in fundamentally reshaping how revenue teams work. We go native with customers—embedding directly in your org to push the boundaries of what's possible and discover the next breakthrough together.

If that's you, let's talk.
