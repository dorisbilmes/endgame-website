## TL;DR

Today, we're thrilled to announce Endgame 2.0, a new AI-native product for enterprise sellers. We're not interested in building AI SDRs or filling inboxes with more spam. Instead, we help you become the trusted advisors your buyers need.

Endgame uses AI to deeply understand you and your buyers by connecting to your CRM, email, and call recorder and analyzing all your interactions. Then, we connect the dots between what you already know and what you need to know by looking at your sales strategy and pulling relevant data from sources like LinkedIn, news, and financial reports.

**The result?**

An intelligent, actionable source of truth for your entire book of business, so you never show up to a meeting feeling unprepared again. Watch the video below to see what we've built:

## The background

Some of you may remember Endgame as PLG CRM or for championing Product-led Sales (PLS). We were fortunate to land Figma, LaunchDarkly, Calendly, Retool, Loom, Airbyte, Algolia, and many other PLG visionaries as customers. Those were exciting times.

Then we realized that as companies scaled, they were trying to move upmarket and prioritized enterprise over high-velocity sales motions. At the same time, we noticed that AI tools in sales were only automating outreach or addressing tactical issues like data entry. So we spent the last few years working closely with the world's most successful enterprise sellers to better understand the art of sales.

Great sellers invested heavily in research to understand the buyer, the business, the market, and the account's history. They spent countless hours mapping their buying committees and re-watching Gong calls at 2x speed to develop informed points of view and win over decision makers. The best of the best did this continuously for their top accounts, working their way into the heads and hearts of their buyers.

But it was impossible to do this for more than a few accounts at a time. It was painfully hard, took incredible skill and will, and required deep tribal knowledge to get right.

We set out to fix this.

## The problem

Every good story has a hero. Our hero is your buyer. And your buyers are more overwhelmed and frustrated than ever. They can't always tell the difference between your product and a competitor's, their budgets are being cut, their jobs are at risk, and they are desperately trying to find solutions to their problems.

But over the last few years, spammy sales tactics have pushed buyers away. More emails, more signals, more playbooks, more tools. All the noise has made it harder than ever to build meaningful relationships with buyers.

This leads to the most important question for the next generation of sales: what do buyers really care about? Hint: it's not another AI-generated email.

Buyers only buy when they see a seller as a trusted advisor, yet 80% of their meetings feel like a waste of time because reps come unprepared. The gap here is clear: preparation is critical and requires continuous discovery and a deep understanding of buyer priorities at scale. But it just hasn't been happening.

Until now.

## The product

Endgame is the first product designed to help enterprise sellers master the art of sales. We're not interested in building AI SDRs or digital workers. Instead, we empower you to be the trusted advisors your buyers need.

Our AI models help you figure out what your buyers care about by analyzing your calls, emails, notes, and external sources like news, 10-Ks, and LinkedIn. We then tailor this information to make it relevant for you, your product offerings, and go-to-market strategy by incorporating your specific business context, messaging, and value frameworks.

Because Endgame is designed specifically for your enterprise sales motion, we're unlike any AI product on the market today. Endgame is:

### Opinionated

We don't just surface data or let you ask questions in a chat UI like Perplexity or ChatGPT. Instead, we structure information based on how the best enterprise sellers approach accounts, allowing you to leverage decades of industry best practices.

### Strategic

Many sales tools help you send emails and manage activities, but only Endgame helps you think. Our goal is to level up your strategy so you can ask better questions during calls, identify new use cases, connect to initiatives, and mitigate risks.

### Easy

Unlike traditional tools that take months to configure and enable, we've designed Endgame to be incredibly easy to set up, maintain, and use. It takes less than 5 minutes to connect your data, and everything is automatically updated going forward. Then anyone on your team can get context when they need it, just by logging in through Salesforce.

Once you start using Endgame, you won't ever want to go back.
