We're incredibly excited to share a major product update that we think will fundamentally change how sales teams work. You can now click into any prospect or customer account in Endgame and ask anything.

## Why "ask anything"?

Every sales team we've spoken with—reps, managers, and executives—is already trying to use ChatGPT, Grok, or similar AI tools to research accounts, build engagement plans, inspect deals, or prep for QBRs.

The problem? These tools aren't connected to your internal data, lack context on your sales methodology and business strategy, and don't understand your stakeholders and personas. They simply weren't designed for sales.

So we fixed that.

My favorite quote from a customer after rolling this out to over 100 reps: "Rollout was amazing. Our team says this is the biggest shift in sales tech in years, maybe decades"—and it honestly feels that way.

## What makes this different

Reps and leaders are falling in love with this because "chat" is a familiar interface that's easy to adopt—everyone is already using consumer AI tools to research accounts, prep for calls, and inspect deals. But Endgame's responses are so bizarrely good because we built and optimized specifically for sales teams, which really comes down to three things:

### Revenue integrations

We've added a number of new internal and external integrations so the AI actually knows what's happening in your accounts and deals. Endgame now supports:

- Salesforce (emails, commercial history, notes, etc.)
- Gong (call transcripts)
- Zoom (call transcripts)
- LinkedIn (job changes, profiles surrounding your accounts)
- EDGAR (10-Ks, earnings calls, financials)
- News (funding announcements, product launches, major hires)
- Company websites (blog posts, career pages, leadership teams)
- Google Drive (your enablement assets, methodologies, and frameworks)

### Domain-specific models

Endgame's models are trained on sales methodologies and frameworks like MEDDPICC and value selling—but we also enable customization because everyone sells a little differently. Our AI understands your sales strategy and process, your products and positioning–not just general knowledge.

### Customer empathy

We've built empathy for what revenue teams are dealing with day to day and sweated every detail. This isn't a consumer AI tool adapted for sales—it's purpose-built for the messy, complex reality of enterprise selling.

## What teams are actually asking

Here are some of the most common questions we're seeing users ask Endgame regularly:

- "Build a stakeholder map and identify who we should multi-thread into"
- "Analyze this deal through a MEDDPICC lens"
- "What's going well and what isn't on this account/deal?"
- "What should we be doing next?"
- "How can we support their current initiatives and priorities?"
- "Give me three ways to position our newest product to this account"
- "Does anyone at my company know anyone at this account?"
- "How would you grade our most recent calls?"
- "WTF is happening in this account?"
- "What are all our deliverables and are we on track?"
- "Compile all product feedback from this account with supporting quotes"

## The future: portfolio-level intelligence

Soon, you'll be able to ask questions about your entire book of business. Imagine having instant answers to questions like:

- "Analyze all my opportunities closing this month through MEDDPICC"
- "Show me all accounts in my book with no open opportunities where I have a 1st degree connection"
- "Give me a win/loss analysis across all our deals in the last 3 months"
- "Find examples from won deals where we overcame the same objections as in this current account"
- "What are similar deals to this that we have won or lost?"
- "Give me a multi-threading grade across all open opportunities for each sales rep"
